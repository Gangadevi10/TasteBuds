    <h2>Burgers</h2>
    <h3>History of Burger!</h3>
    <p>The history of the burger dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its origins in the United States. 
    It evolved from the Hamburg steak, a dish brought to America by German immigrants. 
    The first modern hamburger is believed to have been created in the 1900s, with claims from various sources including Louis Lassen of Louis’ Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Menches Brothers from Ohio.
    The burger gained popularity at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair and became a staple of American cuisine, particularly with the rise of fast-food chains like White Castle in the 1920s and McDonald’s in the 1940s. 
    Today, the burger is a global icon with countless variations enjoyed worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Sandwiches</h2>
    <h3>History of Sandwiches!</h3>
    <p>The popular story attributes the invention of the sandwich to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, an 18th-century English nobleman. 
    An avid gambler, Montagu often found himself not wanting to leave the gaming table for meals.
    He requested his valet to bring him meat tucked between two slices of bread, a request that allowed him to eat without the need for cutlery and without interrupting his game.
    This practical solution to a dining dilemma quickly caught on among his peers.</p>
